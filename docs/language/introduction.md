# Introduction

This guide contains a tour of the Koto language, giving an overview of its features.

You're encouraged to play around with the examples to get a feel for the language. 
The small icon below each example will load the example into the 
[Koto Playground](https://play.koto.dev) where you can run the code and see what 
happens when you make changes.

The guide can be read from start to finish, with later sections building on
concepts introduced in earlier sections.
