# os

A collection of utilities for working with the operating system.

## command

```kototype
|program: String| -> Command
```

Creates a new [Command](#command-1), which supports executing external programs in separate processes.

Builder methods allow configuration of properties like [command arguments](#command-args) or [environment variables](#command-env) before [spawning](#command-spawn) the program in a new process.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
print! os.command('ls')
  .args('/tmp', '-al')
  .wait_for_output()
  .stdout()
check! ...
```

## name

```kototype
|| -> String
```

Returns a string containing the name of the current operating system, e.g.
"linux", "macos", "windows", etc.

## process_id

```kototype
|| -> Number
```

Returns the ID associated with the current process.

## start_timer

```kototype
|| -> Timer
```

Returns a timer that can be used to measure how much time has passed while a
script is running.

### Example

```koto,skip_check
t = os.start_timer()

# ...after some time...
print "Time taken: ${t.elapsed()}s"

t2 = os.start_timer()
print "Seconds between then and now: ${t2 - t}"
```

## time

```kototype
|| -> DateTime
```

Returns a [DateTime](#datetime) set to the current time, using the local timezone.

```kototype
|timestamp: Number| -> DateTime
```

Returns a [DateTime](#datetime) set to the provided `timestamp` in seconds,
using the local timezone.

```kototype
|timestamp: Number, offset: Number| -> DateTime
```

Returns a [DateTime](#datetime) set to the provided `timestamp` in seconds,
using an `offset` in seconds.

### Example

```koto,skip_check
print! now = os.time()
# e.g. 2021-12-11 21:51:14

print! now.year()
# e.g. 2021

print! now.hour()
# e.g. 21

print! now.timestamp()
# e.g. 1639255874.53419
```

## Command

See [`os.command`](#command)

## Command.args

```kototype
|Command, args...| -> Command
```

Adds the given arguments to the command, and returns the command.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
print! os.command('ls')
  .args('/tmp', '-al')
  .wait_for_output()
  .stdout()
check! ...
```

## Command.current_dir

```kototype
|Command, path: String| -> Command
```

Sets the command's working directory, and returns the command.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
print! os.command('ls')
  .current_dir('/tmp')
  .wait_for_output()
  .stdout()
check! ...
```

## Command.env

```kototype
|Command, key: String, value: String| -> Command
```

Sets an environment variable, and returns the command.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
assert os.command('env')
  .env 'FOO', '123'
  .wait_for_output()
  .stdout()
  .contains 'FOO=123'
```

## Command.env_clear

```kototype
|Command| -> Command
```

Clears all environment variables for the command, and returns the command.

This prevents the command from inheriting any environment variables from the parent process.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
assert os.command('env')
  .env_clear()
  .wait_for_output()
  .stdout()
  .is_empty()
```

## Command.env_remove

```kototype
|Command, key: String| -> Command
```

Removes the environment variable matching the given key, and returns the command.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
assert os.command('env')
  .env_clear()
  .env 'FOO', '123'
  .env_remove 'FOO'
  .wait_for_output()
  .stdout()
  .is_empty()
```

## Command.stdin

```kototype
|Command, stream_config: String| -> Command
```

Configures the command's `stdin` stream.

Valid values of `stream_config` are:
- `inherit`: the stream will be inherited from the parent process.
- `piped`: a pipe will be created to connect the parent and child processes.
- `null`: the stream will be ignored.

The default stream behavior is `inherit` when the command is used with `spawn` or `wait_for_exit`, and `piped` when used with `wait_for_output`.

## Command.stdout

```kototype
|Command, stream_config: String| -> Command
```

Configures the command's `stdout` stream.

See [Command.stdin](#command-stdin) for valid values of `stream_config`.

## Command.stderr

```kototype
|Command, stream_config: String| -> Command
```

Configures the command's `stderr` stream.

See [Command.stdin](#command-stdin) for valid values of `stream_config`.

## Command.spawn

```kototype
|Command| -> Child
```

Executes the command, returning the command's [Child](#child) process.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
spawned = os.command('ls')
  .stdout('piped')
  .spawn()

print! spawned
  .wait_for_output()
  .stdout()
check! ...
```

## Command.wait_for_output

```kototype
|Command| -> CommandOutput
```

Executes the command and waits for it to exit, returning its captured [output](#CommandOutput).

### Example

```koto,skip_run
print! os.command('ls').wait_for_output().stdout()
check! ...
```

## Command.wait_for_exit

```kototype
|Command| -> Number?
```

Executes the command and waits for it to exit, returning its exit code if the command exited normally, or `null` if it was interrupted.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
print! os.command('ls').wait_for_exit()
check! 0
```


## CommandOutput

Contains captured output from a command, and information about how the command exited.

See [Command.wait_for_output](#command-wait_for_output) and [Child.wait_for_output](#child-wait-for-output).

## CommandOutput.exit_code

```kototype
|CommandOutput| -> Number?
```

Returns the command's exit code if available.

## CommandOutput.success

```kototype
|CommandOutput| -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the command exited successfully.

## CommandOutput.stdout

```kototype
|CommandOutput| -> String?
```

Returns the contents of the command's `stdout` stream if it contains valid unicode, or `null` otherwise.

### See also

- [CommandOutput.stdout_bytes](#commandoutput-stdout_bytes)

## CommandOutput.stderr

```kototype
|CommandOutput| -> String?
```

Returns the contents of the command's `stderr` stream if it contains valid unicode, or `null` otherwise.

## CommandOutput.stdout_bytes

```kototype
|CommandOutput| -> Iterator
```

Returns an iterator that yields the bytes contained in the command's `stdout` stream.

## CommandOutput.stderr_bytes

```kototype
|CommandOutput| -> Iterator
```

Returns an iterator that yields the bytes contained in the command's `stderr` stream.

## Child

A handle to a child process, see [Command.spawn](#command-spawn).

## Child.stdin

```kototype
|Child| -> File
```

Returns the child process's `stdin` standard input stream as a [File](./io.md#File) that supports write operations.

### Example

```koto,skip_run
spawned = os.command('cat')
  .stdin 'piped'
  .spawn()

stdin = spawned.stdin()
stdin.write_line 'hello'
stdin.write_line 'one two three'

print! spawned.wait_for_output().stdout()
check! hello
check! one two three
```

## Child.stdout

```kototype
|Child| -> File
```

Returns the child process's `stdout` standard output stream as a [File](./io.md#File) that supports read operations.

Calling this function will prevent the stream from being included in [wait_for_output](#child-wait-for-output).

## Child.stderr

```kototype
|Child| -> File
```

Returns the child process's `stderr` standard error stream as a [File](./io.md#File) that supports read operations.

Calling this function will prevent the stream from being included in [wait_for_output](#child-wait-for-output).

## Child.has_exited

```kototype
|Child| -> Bool
```

Returns `true` without blocking if the child process has exited, and `false` otherwise.

## Child.wait_for_output

```kototype
|Child| -> CommandOutput
```

Closes all input and output streams, waits for the command to exit, and then returns the captured output.

Note that if the `stdout` or `stderr` streams were manually retrieved via [Child.stdout](#child-stdout)/[Child.stderr](#child-stderr) then they won't be included in the captured output.

## Child.wait_for_exit

```kototype
|Child| -> Number?
```

Closes all input and output streams, waits for the command to exit, and then returns the command's exit code if available.

## Timer.@- (subtract)

```kototype
|Timer, Timer| -> Number
```

Returns the time difference in seconds between two timers.

### Example

```koto
t1 = os.start_timer()
t2 = os.start_timer()
# t2 was started later than t1, so the time difference is positive
assert (t2 - t1) > 0
# t1 was started earlier than t2, so the time difference is negative
assert (t1 - t2) < 0
```

## Timer.elapsed

```kototype
|Timer| -> Number
```

Returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since the timer was started.

### Example
