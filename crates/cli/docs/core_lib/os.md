```kototype
|Number, Number| -> DateTime
```

Returns a DateTime set to the provided timestamp in seconds,

print! now = os.time()
# e.g. 2021-12-11 21:51:14

print! now.year()
# e.g. 2021

print! now.hour()
# e.g. 21

print! now.timestamp()
# e.g. 1639255874.53419
```

Returns a string representing the DateTime's timezone offset in seconds.

## Timer

See [`os.start_timer`](#start_timer).

## Timer.@- (subtract)

```kototype
|Timer, Timer| -> Float
```

Returns the time difference in seconds between two timers.

### Example

```koto
t1 = os.start_timer()
t2 = os.start_timer()
# t2 was started later than t1, so the time difference is positive
assert (t2 - t1) > 0
# t1 was started earlier than t2, so the time difference is negative
assert (t1 - t2) < 0
```

## Timer.elapsed

```kototype
|Timer| -> Float
```

Returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since the timer was started.

### Example

```koto,skip_check
t = os.start_timer()

# ...after some time...
